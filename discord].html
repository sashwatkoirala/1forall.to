<p style="font-size: 35px"> Since Frogs Dream World (FDW) is a part of the dream network, you will find that it is interconnected with other communities such as Slippys Dream World or Skarz Dream World. You get to know one person in one server and you may unexpectedly spot them again in a completely different one. It is very likely to happen since there are over 150,000 people in FDW.
They had such a large influx of members that they had to purge nearly 1/4th of their member count to make room for new users. These emotes are in very high demand! This server is a must for people who collect global emotes. The server is centered around global emotes but that does not mean it is the only purpose of the server. Whenever the server is active it is an enjoyable place to spend time in and a great place to meet others. You can’t miss this one.</p>

The Daddy server is one of the most active servers on Discord. The server is a socializing server mainly based around voice channels. The most unique aspect of this server is that it is targeted towards users who enjoy speaking in voice channels. Offering 20+ voice channels that never die, the Daddy server is the best place to go to communicate with others through voice. At any given moment, there will usually be over 60 people total in their voice channels. This gives you a variety of different rooms to join with all sorts of different people. If you prefer to speak in text channels, that is great too, because their text chats also rarely die. In fact, over 9 million messages have been sent in their lounge in total. However, their voice channels are their main attraction. Here’s a sneak peek of their voice channels at 9 AM EST.
